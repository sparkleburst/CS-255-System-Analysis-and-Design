# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? 
The client was a company called DriverPass who wanted to create a resource to help people pass their driving exams on the first attempt. They wanted to design a system that had levels of users that could access various types of content. The users also would be able to schedule in-person training and in-person behind-the-wheel lessons with certified instructors. This system was meant to manage all of this and provide the admins with special functions like turning off packages that they no longer want to offer.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe that I understood the requirements of DriverPass and made good activity diagrams to represent what had to happen in steps to get through different processes. I used the interview notes to make sure the needs of the client were being respected within the system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 
I would change my class diagram. I would like to put more thought into the methods required in each class as I believe there could be better connectivity.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 
I started off by reading the interview transcript to identify the needs of DRiverPass and used them to figure out the potential needs of customers. Considering user needs is important because if the needs of the client are not met sufficiently then there will be issues and reworking necessary which will take up extra time that was not needed and may affect developer payment and/or reputation. All around it is best to consider needs and be sure that you can explain that they have been covered and implemented into the system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When developing software, I read all of the requirements first and write down the essentials. Then, I try to isolate the objects in the system and work out how they will interact. Sometimes I use a UML Class Diagram for this, but I have found use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and sequence diagrams to be very useful also. Once I understand the flow and connectivity of the system I will begin coding. Building the diagrams helps me to think of things that I may miss if I just jumped right into coding. In the future, I will probably make extensive use of the UML diagrams for outlining how a system is supposed to work. I think that they are a big help in designing the system to work as expected.
